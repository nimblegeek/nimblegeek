Hey, I'm Jonas Achouri Sihl√©n, casually called TheNimblegeek in tech and in movement circles. I work as a Platform Engineer in the financial service industry and have a strong passion for developer experience, problem solving and continuous learning. My tech toolbox includes Kubernetes, Ansible and Linux. Flavoured with proficiency with Python, Java, SpringBoot and a slash of JavaScript.

I'm a guy who loves to learn how to build cool projects, be productive, and ultimately craft awesome software. I started to learn to code at 39 while raising a family of 5 and growing as an online writer. I like to write.

Writing is not only a passion of mine, but a necessity for me to think and solve problems through life. I've decided to focus on growing as an online writer alongside my 9-5. As I'm exploring wider topics I found interesting I wite and share the ones I find useful to share. This is a lifelong journey.
