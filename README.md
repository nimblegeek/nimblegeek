Hey, I'm Jonas Achouri Sihl√©n, casually called TheNimblegeek in tech and movement circles. I work as a platform engineer in the financial service industry and have a strong passion for developer experience, problem solving and continuous learning. My tech toolbox includes Kubernetes, Ansible and Linux. Flavoured with proficiency with Python, Java and SpringBoot and a slash of JavaScript.

I'm a guy who loves to learn how to build cool projects, be productive, and ultimately craft awesome software. I started to learn to code at 39 while raising a family of 5.
