## Timeline highlights

Hey there, I'm Jonas. I am a curious guy who is trying to make things on the internet and learn more about what makes a great developer experience. Ultimately I am geeking out on platforms and developer workflows mostly. I don't hold a CS, but I have been curious enough to work in tech full-time. It turned out to be more fun than trying to balance financial statements. 
I am driven by building useful stuff, mostly using technology as leverage.
